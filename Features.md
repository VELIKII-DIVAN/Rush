* Planned support of 1.8 (some code implemented)
* 1.5.2 Client joinable, although no support

* Flat world generation.
* World ticking. E.g. turning grass into dirt (since it thinks there is 0 light level - fixed when lightning is implemented)
* Spawnable entities (No AI)
* Implemented some blocks, their sounds and block drops.

* Basic entity interaction and test AI.
* Block placing & removing + partial interaction (bonemeal, hoe making farmland, ...)
* Packet logging.
* World saving (/save-all) and loading
